the very big sandwich that had been half-eaten by tim and moby lay on the table that they were sitting at
all day long my beautiful fish swam in her tank in my room beacuse she was happy
casey counted 3 lorries 2 cars 9 vans and 0 motorbikes
sarah picked up the old dusty book
jardan crept into the dark dank cave
the huge red train whizzed past the children
at the zoo i saw the tigers lions bears and giraffes
the frail old lady hobbled along the road
my mom surprised me with a cute fluffy kitten
fred looked at the shiny expensive gold
