He is beautiful and easy to care for;his medium white fur needs no extra brushing.
Playing with him is lots of fun.I throw a tennis ball and he bounces off to retrieve it.
He always takes care of me:he prances upto me whenever I say ,"OW!!!" and licks my face.
The author Aldous Hugsly once said,"To his dog,every man is Napolean;hence, the constant 
popularity of dogs".As I consider the pet I would like to have share my life,it's Hugsly's
quote that sums up why a dog would be the best choice.
Because of it's of loyalty,it's ability to be trained, and it's great companionship,a dog
that is the perfect pet for me.
