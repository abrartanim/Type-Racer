This sentence hads five words.Here are five more words.
Five word sentences are fine but several together become monotonous.
Listen to what is happening.The writing is getting boring.
The sound of it drones it's like a stuck record.The ear demands some variety.

Now listen I vary the sentence length and I create music,the writing sings
it has a pleasant rythm,a lilt, a harmony.I use shot sentences.
And I use sentences of medium length . And sometimes when I'm certain the reader
is rested.I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence 
that burns with energy and builds with all the impetous of a crescendo.
